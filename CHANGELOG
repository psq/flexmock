= Changes for FlexMock

== Pre-Version 0.6.3

* Fixed comment for singleton?
* Fixed coverage report for the partial mocking class.
	
== Version 0.6.2

* flexmock() with a block now always returns the domain object.
  flexmock() without a block returns the mock object.  Note that for
  normal mocks, the domain and mock objects are the same.  For partial
  mocks, the mock is separate from the domain object.
* Added +and_raise+ to the list of expection specifications.	

== Version 0.6.1

* Fixed bug that prevented mocks from mocking field assignment operators.
* Fixed bug that prevented partial mocks from being ordered.

== Version 0.6.0

* Dropped class interception.
* Refactored into more granular classes.
* Added RSpec integration.
* Added hash expectations to flexmock() and should_expect().
* Integrated partial mocks into the flexmock() methods.
* Allow non-block configuration of new_instances.

== Version 0.5.1

* Changed the name of any_instance to new_instances.  
  Deprecated any_instance.
* Added ability to stub any class method in new_instances.

  procs.
* Fixed bug in stubbing File class methods.

== Version 0.5.0

* Added any_instance stubbing to class objects.

== Version 0.4.2

* Fixed bug where multiple stubs of a class method were not
  properly restored.
	
== Version 0.4.1

* Removed include of Test::Unit::Assertions from Expectations.
* Fixed mocking of kernel methods.

== Version 0.4.0

* Added stubbing for mocking methods of existing objects.
* Added multiple return values for the +and_returns+ method.
* Added block initialization to the flexmock method.

== Version 0.3.2

* Fixed bug when mock is used as a replacement class in class
  interception.

== Version 0.3.1

* Fixed some warnings regarding uninitialized variables.
* Added (very) simple class interception.
* Added the mock_factory method to go along with class interception.
* When using Test::Unit integration, avoid mock verification if the
  test has already failed for some reason.

* Added Test::Unit integration.

== Version 0.2.1

* Added strict mode in record mode interface to facility using known
  good algorithms for comparison testing.
* Improved the docs and examples.  Fixed garbled first example in
  README. 
	
== Version 0.2.0

* Fixed a bunch of documentation.

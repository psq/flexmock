  # #########################################################################
  # PartialMock is used to mate the mock framework to an existing object.  The
  # object is "enhanced" with a reference to a mock object (stored in
  # <tt>@flexmock_mock</tt>).  When the +should_receive+ method is sent to the
  # proxy, it overrides the existing object's method by creating  singleton
  # method that forwards to the mock.  When testing is complete, PartialMock
  # will erase the mocking infrastructure from the object being mocked (e.g.
  # remove instance variables and mock singleton methods).

    # Declare that the partial mock should receive a message with the given
    # name.
    #
    # If more than one method name is given, then the mock object should
    # expect to receive all the listed melthods.  If a hash of method
    # name/value pairs is given, then the each method will return the
    # associated result.  Any expectations applied to the result of
    # +should_receive+ will be applied to all the methods defined in the
    # argument list.
    #
    # An expectation object for the method name is returned as the result of
    # this method.  Further expectation constraints can be added by chaining
    # to the result.

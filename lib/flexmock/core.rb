######################################################################
# FlexMock is a flexible mock object framework for supporting testing.
#
# FlexMock has a simple interface that's easy to remember, and leaves 
# the hard stuff to all those other mock object implementations.
#
# Basic Usage:
#
#   m = flexmock("name")
#   m.should_receive(:upcase).with("stuff").
#     and_return("STUFF")
#   m.should_receive(:downcase).with(String).
#     and_return { |s| s.downcase }.once
#
# With Test::Unit Integration:
#
#   class TestSomething < Test::Unit::TestCase
#     include FlexMock::TestCase
#
#     def test_something
#       m = flexmock("name")
#       m.should_receive(:hi).and_return("Hello")
#       m.hi
#     end
#   end
#
# Note: When using Test::Unit integeration, don't forget to include
# FlexMock::TestCase.  Also, if you override +teardown+, make sure you
# call +super+.
#

  # Declare that the mock object should receive a message with the given name.
  #
  # If more than one method name is given, then the mock object should expect
  # to receive all the listed melthods.  If a hash of method name/value pairs
  # is given, then the each method will return the associated result.  Any
  # expectations applied to the result of +should_receive+ will be applied to
  # all the methods defined in the argument list.
  #
  # An expectation object for the method name is returned as the result of
  # this method.  Further expectation constraints can be added by chaining to
  # the result.
  #
  # See Expectation for a list of declarators that can be used.

  # Declare that the mock object should expect methods by providing a
  # recorder for the methods and having the user invoke the expected

  #
  #   mock.should_expect do |record|

  #     }.at_least.once
